# Properties of Egalitarian Societies

## What is Egalitarianism

* People are equal in their political and economic standing
  * Determines what they have access to and their opportunities
  * Also known as **Band-level** societies
* May still have different status
  * e.g., old people are revered
  * men and women have different, but equal, statuses
    * e.g., father vs mother

## Economics

* **hunting and gathering** as subsistence system
  * Hallmark of egalitarian societies
  * Farming came into existence about 7000 years ago
* **Technology** - extremely rudimentary, but functional
  * Our society has bias for technology "muscle"
  * Ju'Hoansi technology still does the job
  * They can fit all their tech in a bag so they can get up and leave
* **Nomadic**: seasonal movement
  * In wet season, group splits between four watering holes
  * In dry season, watering holes dry up and they combine groups
    * More people together

### Collective ownership

* Anything that is critical to the wellbeing of the group is owned collectively
  * Share key resources: *Land*, food, weapons, etc.
  * no wealth distinctions
  * windfalls and shortages are distributed evenly
    * never saying please or thank you
      * "it's your right to have a share of meat"
      * "with thanks, you make slaves"
* Individual ownership of unimportant things e.g. personal earrings
  * The person that made the weapon that killed the deer gets a special extra share
    * Straddled the line between individual and collective ownership
* Sharing keeps a lid on jealousy
  * When Nai's daughter gets picked on for allegedly cheating, it's because Nai's "not sharing"
    * Erosion of their cultural system
  * Changing of cultural system has historically been devastating for indigenous communities

### Population

* small and low density: cultures of several thousand
  * The community is more face-to-face and has better understanding of each other because they all know each  other
  * Spread out large distance to hunt
* no full-time division of labor
  * no specialists
  * everyone does everything

## Society

### Why there is gender equality in San society

* Economics is subsistence system, so women's contributions are seen as equally important to subsistence
  * Specifically, when men were unable to successfully hunt game (which is 2/3 of the time), women are able to gather enough to subsist society
  * Women could easily gather enough to subsist society and provide the major portion of caloric intake for the group
* Even though hunting/men and gathering/women is the general tendency, it is not strictly divided
  * this tendency is due to the fact that it works well for society, not anything intrinsic to the activity
* Side effects of gender equality:
  * HIV rates very low
    * very far apart from others
    * women's status - if they want a condom they get it

### Marriage

* Marriage is universal concept among societies
  * Goals
    * finding an orderly way for people to reproduce
    * building relationships between unrelated groups
      * structural alliance
      * avoids conflict
  * social, political, and economic arrangement
  * not necessarily like marriage in US
* Arranged marriages
  * San has arranged marriages, sometimes from birth
  * Arranged marriages take away decision making ability from individuals, but it's still gender equality because individuals can push back
    * Nai expressed disapproval of situation by refusing her husband and repeatedly cheating on him, with impunity
    * Nisa caused such a stink over arranged marriage that it was cancelled
  * Usually, the arranged marriage works out because it is about:
    * providing for children
    * alliances between family
    * access to land
    * NOT about love
  * If arranged marriage doesn't work out, individuals can divorce and remarry by choice
    * not viewed as "divorcee" afterwards
    * next marriages are not arranged
    * anything goes. If it works, it works
