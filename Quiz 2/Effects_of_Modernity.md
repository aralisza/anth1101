# Effects of Modernity

## 20th Century Bantu

* Grazing cattle
  * Graze very closely to the soil, deplete the soil, rain wash the topsoil away and makes the area uninhabitable in the long run
  * Used watering holes in existence, lower water table
* Lowered ability of Ju'hoansi to find food and water
* Bantu, Herrero treated Ju'hoansi as if they were subservient
* Ju'hoansi lived in a very remote area so they were able to hold on to their culture for a longer time than other peoples
  * but by mid-60s, that was over as well
  * "distance shrunk over time" - roads, electricity, and other transportation technology
    * distance protected population from diseases like hiv, but even when distance closed, hiv rates still low because of strong women

## Creating towns

* One street towns
  * new concept of moving people *through* the town
  * bring new peoples and ideas through
* Response to something bad happening was picking up and move
  * but now, can't move
* Shabeens: tiny bars
  * all up and down the main street
  * cheap alcohol
  * eerily similar to reservations in US
  * ingesting alcohol is a phasic phenomenon
    * the ultimate outcome is bad
    * but the initial stages is valuable, performs a function
      * when new person goes to a town, they go to a bar and find connections in the local area
      * establishes support
  * who creates/runs/benefits from the shabeens?
    * Ju'hoansi women
    * When Ju'hoansi society is stripped of power, Ju'hoansi women held on

## Sovereignty

* Baaskap: boss ship
  * reproduction of colonial relationship
  * even though Ju'hoansi people get educated (or other assistance) in South Africa, it's not to become doctor, lawyer etc. It's to return to their "rightful place" at the bottom rung of society
  * doesn't help with sovereignty
* Sovereignty: political control and autonomy
  * Land claims
    * Ju'hoansi was able to get some traditional land back through land claims case
  * Tourism
    * go there to see the wildlife and the natives as you expected to see
    * lock the people into their indigeneity
      * when rich natives drive vans, they have "sold out"
      * however, when they're dirt poor, then they're "authentic"
    * some Ju'hoansi groups try to take control of tourism industry, but Baaskap is in their way, can't break into management
    * however, some success
      * tourism companies wanted to show healing dances, but the Ju people had forgotten how to do it. They had to go to the old people and reproduce tradition
      * taking control part of it is one step to take control of their future
  * agency
  * craft production
