# Conflict Resolution

## Our system

* Mediation
  * two individuals give power to third party to decide for them
  * courts, arbitrators, mediators
  * typically in society with an authority (state)

## Egalitarian societies' system

* tier based system of intervention
* can't do mediation like we have because they don't have a central authority
* **kin-based**
  * face to face, intimate society
  * people know you too well

### 1. **fight or flight**

* avoid conflict with outside groups
  * outside groups include different bands of San people
* get a "bad feeling", just leave
* not "actual conflict resolution"

### 2. **admonishment**

* to reinforce/encourage you in a certain direction
* avoid conflict by giving advice
* when Nai didn't like being in an arranged marriage, his uncle admonished her in a joking way to do it
  * using kinship relationship to get her on board

### 3. **ridicule**

* teasing/making fun of *publicly*
* becomes laughingstock of the group
* it only works because it's a face-to-face society
  * in our society, can just say screw you and leave
  * in their society, it keeps hitting you because you can't get away from the people who ridiculed you
* the Inuit people have formalized public ridicule
  * official public roasting duels
  * becomes a contest
  * doesn't matter who wins, because the conflict is resolved

### 4. **ostracism**

* socially remove someone
* antithetical to human condition
* examples:
  * Bambuti of the Congo
    * hut configuration faced the center of community

    * Turnbull describes an incident where one person was being difficult
      * the other households moved away and set up again without him maybe 1/4 mile away
      * he could hear them
        * served as a warning before excommunication
        * can either quietly come back to group or leave
  * Ojibwa (Northern NA - Subarctic)
    * one person killed another in a drunken rage
    * government police doesn't cover the area very often
    * so, they ostracized her, equal to death sentence in late fall

### 5. **capital punishment**

* Ju'hoansi
  * if someone kills another person, there is an "imbalance"
    * need to get vengeance
  * vicious cycle
  * need to negotiate with the other group that they will take capital punishment so vicious cycle doesn't happen
* Windigo psychosis (Ojibwa)
  * the monster enters a person when they are too anxious or stressed
    * you begin to see other people as animals that you can eat
  * but, there was never an act of cannibalism
  * accuse someone of who was socially isolated or someone who was in a family that was a part of a conflict
    * eventually kill that person
  * effectively a witch hunt
    * power struggle (economic conflict)
    * if one group can convince everyone in the other group that you're a Windigo, it's over
