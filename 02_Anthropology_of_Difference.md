## Ethnocentrism: Self-other distinctions

Own culture as the lens for looking at other cultures

* Humans are obsessed with creating self-other distinctions
  * Self group vs other group
    * For some Native Americans, name for other group literally means "others", "they're not like us", "they're less than us"
    * *"others"* = demonized
* Bias everyone has by virtue of learning their culture
  * Nuclear family - a social construction
  * *Custer* - tried to wipe out the Lakota
    * Killed by lakota, was a demon to them
    * Martyr for white colonizers

## Cultural Relativism: Anthropologists' historical weapon against Ethnocentrism

Placing yourself in another culture, fosters awareness of other cultures and weakens ethnocentric tendencies

* Created by [Franz Boas](#franz-boas-father-of-american-anthropology)
  * In-depth immersion
    * Doesn't have to be traditional field work
    * Can be in own neighborhood by getting to know neighbors from other cultures
* Having enough understanding about a group other than own
  * Actually understand why each aspect of another culture exists and what it's about

## Important Anthropological Figures

### Franz Boas: Father of American Anthropology

* Believed cultural diffusion rather than cultural evolution
  * Used fieldwork
  * **Cultural Evolution**: other cultures are inherently inferior and have negative traits
    * e.g., Italians & criminality
    * Essentializing cultures
  * **Cultural Diffusion**: History creates culture
  * First public anthropologist
    * Advocacy instead of neutral science

### Margaret Mead

* Student of Franz Boas
* Studied transition from childhood to adulthood for young women in Samoa
  * Adolescence was a smooth transition
    * Not marked by emotional or psychological distress like in the US
  * Emphasized nurture (culture) over nature (genetics)

## Anthropology of Difference

* Cultural differences interpreted through an ethnocentric lens
* People being placed in some sort of border, interpreted as being better or worth
* *Social self-loathing*
  * Dominicans
    * Good hair vs bad hair
      * Good hair = hair that blows in the wind (white people)
      * Bad hair = hair that doesn't blow in the wind (non white people)
    * Where people were historically slaves, those features are interpreted as less than
  * "Jewish" nose, wanting nose job to be more anglo-saxon

### Genital Modification

* What
  * Partial clitoris removal
  * Full clitoris removal
  * Labial sewing
  * Other
* Why
  * Fear that women can have uncontrolled sexual desires
  * Want husband to control wife sexual desires
  * Only women with FGM are ok to marry
  * Culture wants to reproduce itself, so it is a coherent cultural system
* Tests the limits of cultural relativism
  * After hearing why it makes sense in the culture, is it ok now?
  * *Conclusion*: American Anthropology Association condemns FGM
  * Cultural relativism is still important, but an individual still has the right to take a stance

### Organ Trade

* Structural violence of everyday life impacting the poor.
* Poor are inaudible.
  * Body theft rumors are seen as a ‘surrogate” for of witnessing
* “Little people like ourselves are worth more dead than alive.”

## Tools of Anthropology

1. Participant observation
2. Field Interview
    * How to transcribe?
3. Formal Interview
4. Ethnohistory

## Field Methods

### Traditional method (Branislaw Malinowski)

* Lengthy stays in the field.
* Participant-Observer Status.
* Language acquisition.
* Early anthropologists cultivated the authoritative voice.
* Pure scientific research model.
* Holistic view of culture.
* Final results: an *ethnography* of the culture.

### Problem with traditional method (Crisis of representation)

* Can we ever really know all that there is of any culture (even our own)?
* How will we ever account for everyone in culture we are studying?
* Who is really at the heart of our work?  And, who is ignored?
* What ‘voice’ should we actually use?

### How to succeed at fieldwork

* Not accepting the view that we are ‘experts’.
* Understanding that erring is part of learning another culture.
* Becoming part of the exchange networks that make up cultures.
* Good sense of humor about yourself.
* Use multiple methods (qualitative and quantitative).
* Cultivating as wide a network as possible.
* Forging relations with those one wouldn’t normally engage (e.g. If you are a man, then women).
* Triangulate statements over time
