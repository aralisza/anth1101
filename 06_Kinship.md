# Kinship

* Goal: Ties societies together

## Kinship system

* Kinship systems vary based on culture
  * Nore: Area for hunting and gathering that a tribe has the right to use
* **Bilateral kinship system**
  * hereditary, marriage, what we typically think of as kinship
  * Collect terms to represent familial names (ex. Father, mother, cousin, etc.)
  * Triangles in family tree represent men, circles represent women, equal sign represents marriage, shapes on same level represent one generation
  * Terms for immediate (nuclear) family different from terms to represent non-immediate relatives
  * Example: Inuit
* **Naming Kinship system**
  * Linguistic shifts in familial naming system
  * Does not follow bilateral system of Inuit, names are assigned independently
  * People with same name as you are related to you
  * Example: Ju'hoansi, Iroquois
* Hawaiian: Wi
  * Same sex siblings are mothers and fathers
* Sudanese
  * every person is linked to you
* simple logistical systems to categorize familial relationships
* Ju'hoansi
  * Adopt 3 systems: Bilateral, Naming, and Wi systems
  * Wi: Age gives you a little more respect

## Residence/Descent

* Residence after marriage
  * Neolocal: after marriage, people want to live in their own place
  * Patrilocal: married couple lives with the man's family
  * Matrilocal: married couple lives with the woman's family (Iroquois)
  * Ambilocal: not skewed towards one or another, anything goes
* Descent/Inheritance Strongly correlated with residence
  * Your children are technically a part of whatever tribe you live with after marriage
  * Matrilocal => Matrilineal
    * Example: Iroquois
  * Patrilocal => Patrilineal
    * many cultures have patrilineal systems: rights and privileges move through the male side
    * as societies become more complex, patrilineal societies tend to win out
    * When land, wealth, and agriclture comes in to play, becomes more Patrilocal
  * Ambilocal => Ambilineal
    * Example: U.S. now?
