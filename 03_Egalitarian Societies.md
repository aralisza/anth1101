## Egalitarian Societies

* **Egalitarian**: people are equal in their political economic standing
  * What they have access to and their opportunities
  * Also known as **Band-level** societies
* May still have different status
  * e.g., old people are revered
  * men and women have different, but equal, statuses
    * e.g., father vs mother
* **Collective ownership** for key resources
  * *Land*, food, weapons, etc.
  * Anything that is critical to the wellbeing of the group
  * Individual ownership of unimportant things e.g. personal earrings
  * The person that made the weapon that killed the deer gets a special extra share
    * Straddled the line between individual and collective ownership
* Subsistence system = hunting and gathering
  * Hallmark of egalitarian societies
  * Farming came into existence about 7000 years ago
* **Population was small** - cultures of several thousand
  * The community is more face-to-face and has better understanding of each other because they all know each  other
* **Population density is extremely low**
  * Spread out large distance to hunt
* Both above for **economic reasons**
* **Technology** - extremely rudimentary
  * Our society has bias for technology "muscle"
  * Ju'Hoansi technology still does the job
  * They can fit all their tech in a bag so they can get up and leave
* **Nomadic**: seasonal movement
  * In wet season, group splits between four watering holes
  * In dry season, watering holes dry up and they combine groups
    * More people together
