## What is Anthropology

### Archaeology: study of remains

Goal 1: Reconstructing cultures that are no longer in existence

* **Mandan**: North America
  * Settled villages, farming
    * Villages made from wood
    * Remains had all decomposed
  * Discolorations in the soil suggested there was rotting wood, so we know they were there
    * Never saw actual village, but have evidence of existence

Goal 2: In recent times, reconstructing current cultures by their remains

* Pick through garbage of a city to see what they used and threw away

### Physical Anthropology

Deals with human remains

* Where are the missing links between modern humans and earlier forms?
* What is the impact of the climate on current people?
  * **Hunter's response**: sub arctic peoples adapting to the cold
    * Normal people have one spike in body temperature after plunging into cold water, then they get paralyzed pretty quickly
    * Northern people have multiple higher spikes of body temperature so they get paralyzed by cold slower, giving them an *adaptive advantage*
* Forensic anthropology (Bones)
* How do diseases spread?

### Linguistics

How languages change over time

* *"Fleeing Elite"*
  * Elite use language to create distance between upper and lower class
  * You can have new money, but you won't have grown up in the society of old money, creating distance

### Cultural Anthropology

Study of *cultures* and how they shape society. What this class is about.

## Culture

### Patterned

* one-off human behaviors are not culture
  * example: in some cities, people avoid eye contact

### Shared

* shared within the group/population
  * Does not necessarily have to follow borders

### Learned

* Formal
  * Nationalism through saying Pledge of Allegiance
  * Saying please and thank you (Parents)
  * How to interact with superiors (Teachers)
* Informal
  * Space (*Proximics*)
    * How far/close you can stand to a person based on how close of a relationship  you have
