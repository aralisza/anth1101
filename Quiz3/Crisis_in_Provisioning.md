# Changes

## Crisis in Provisioning

* refers to erosion of egalitarian relations in late 19th century
    * e.g., status of women went down when horses and buffalo hunting period began
        * also, just as quickly as buffalo hunting period began, they ended when buffalo was hunted to near extinction by white people
        * no more basis for economy so slowly, tribe by tribe, started to trickle into reservations
    * those with little or no access to basics are vulnerable
* collective norms still working but less efficiently
    * private property relations began to gain traction
        * "that arrow is mine, so that buffalo is mine"
        * supposed to share, but the arrow that killed the buffalo was effectively a property marker
    * what happens to those without sons or husbands to hunt for them?
        * **Crisis in provisioning**: these people are left out in the cold. who will care for them?
    * values around being generous and caring for the "people" but not by necessity.
        * built in reminders in society to share
        * *Tieing the tail*: if you want a piece of buffalo but you didn't contribute to killing it, you can tie the tail using an article of your clothing to claim a piece

## The impact of hide trade

* introduces new technology
    * guns, metal goods
* increased dependency on ancillary goods like cosmetics and liquor
    * not all groups were becoming equally reliant on the trade
        * *Loaf About the Fort Indians*: groups that would stick around white people's fort and trade for alcohol and become alcoholics
        * Others traded only for what they needed
        * leads to **factionalism**

## The great sioux reservation

* Lakota attacked Fort Laramie, made it too dangerous for wagon settlers
    * US sued for peace following a string of Lakota victories
    * US was too busy with the civil war, so no resources to deal with natives
* Created Great Sioux Reservation through Treaty of 1868
    * At that moment, Lakota were perceived as an independent sovereign nation
    * the only people that settled in the reservations at first were the loaf about the fort indians
    * after the buffalo herd shrunk into the reservation, the tribes started to sign on
        * but the aggressive indians only signed on for the tough winters and bolted after

## Peopleing the reservation

* lakota bands and **Tiospaye** (large extended families)

## "Friendlies" V. "Hostiles"

* This split is the second generation of factionalism among the Lakota
    * "Friendlies" were offspring of the loaf about the fort indians of the hide era
    * "Hostiles" were offspring of those bands wanting autonomy (e.g., Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse)
* US government Indian agents needed to get the respect of the Hostiles
    * Hostiles were hunting and bringing home food and gaining respect
    * Friendlies were letting the whites take care of them
    * Indian agents gave all the resources to the Friendlies to share among themselves and the Hostiles were given a lot less
        * this increased tensions between the two factions
        * turned Friendlies into "treaty chief" or "uncle tomahawk" or "apples" (red on outside, white on inside) that do white man's bidding
    * **Red Cloud**: Used to be a Hostile but turned into a Friendly after entering reservation
        * Give them an all expenses paid trip to Washington DC to meet the president
        * "White people are like sands in the shore" - there's a lot of white folk out there and there's a few of us. I don't think we have a chance
        * By the time they give back, they are no longer a Hostile
        * Red Cloud wanted catholic boarding school - Holy Rosary
            * was a disaster
            * both sex scandal and cultural genocide
            * "you have to kill the indian to save the child"
            * 1960's - it was no longer cool to oppress people
                * let's change the name to Red Cloud and offer Lakota language classes
                * was it a change of heart? probably not because they never acknowledged the bad they did
