# The solution to the "Indian Problem"

* How to assimilate natives?
    * Pratt - boarding school, getting at kids
    * Baum (creator of wizard of oz) - genocide
* foreign policy crafted by congress too far away from the ground level

## Black Hills

* center of the Great Sioux Reservation
* there was gold in the hills, tons of miners flooded in
* government supported the flood of white miners, government protected them
    * legal precedent for US to just take it back
    * created a series of congressional acts to take back land
    * violate the treaty that US created themselves

## The Allotment Act (Dawes Act) 1889

* They don't have "skin in the game"
* Every single male head of household will be awarded a chunk of land
    * it's in *your* name and not tribal property because the tribal communal culture is part of the problem
    * reallocated reservation land into individual owners' name
* *assumption*: you will protect it and grow it
* *reality*: how will we feed our families in the winter?
    * go to the whites' general store and stock up on food, paying with money
    * instead of having to borrow money, now they have land to trade
    * Pine Ridge reservation was too underdeveloped to grow the land
    * best they can do is lease it to white ranchers
        * doesn't even get to negotiate their rates because the Bureau of Indian Affairs does it for you
* the allotted land was less than the total land on the reservation
    * leftover land goes back to the government which then gets given to white people again

## Indian Reorganization Act 1934

* progressive new head of Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
* wants to stop the bleeding away of Indian land
    * made all land to be held in trust
    * you can give the land to your children, but you can't give it to white people
    * if you sell it to whites, it is no longer part of the reservation
    * Whitemud family from film couldn't hold land as collateral for loans for this reason
* introduce the idea of democratic government
    * hoping to wash away the traditional tribal Lakota politics
    * but politics at this time was very factional
* assume town of Pine Ridge is representative of Pine Ridge Reservation
    * tribal government
    * schools
    * businesses
    * above all in centered in town of Pine Ridge
    * however, only Friendlies controlled town of Pine Ridge
        * "Mixed blood" controlled politics in this town for 100 years
* didn't attempt to engage in the factionalism
    * exacerbated the factional problem
    * only "mixed blood" benefited, "full blood" didn't

## Micro-enterprises

* women tend to start smaller enterprises
    * crafts, restaurants, etc.
* whereas men have little economic basis
* in some regards, the gender balance has leveled since the age of the Indian warrior despite the allotment act
