# Lakota Culture

## Land

* land and culture are deeply connected
* if you look at lakota now, your view is skewed because lakota are effectively incarcerated
    * land is a tiny fraction of what they had before
    * like looking at people that spent 10 years in jail and trying to figure out what they were like before
    * bad conditions bringing out neurotic behavior in people
* plains area
    * rich in large games area
        * huge buffalo herds
        * only Africa has more
    * it's remarkable there were so few tribes there at first
        * it's because hunting large game animals is difficult without being properly equipped
        * no horses - hunting on foot
            * can only trap animals like Ju'hoansi, which isn't super effective

## Horse - A piece of technology

* introduction of horses was revolutionary
* can pick the animal you want instead of taking on the whole herd
* Buffalo Hunter - well trained horse to hunt buffalo
* came from New Mexico area after they were colonized by Spain
    * Spanish brought horse culture with them
    * vs north east colonists who was mainly using horses for farming
* Comanches were the first tribes to get their hands on horses
    * 1710 - they came on foot and were on the bottom of the tribe pecking order
        * poor and impoverished
    * 20 years later, move from the Rockies into New Mexico
        * stole horses, became part of their culture
        * rich, aggressive, and successful
* benefits of technology unevenly effect populations
    * winners and losers in every technological advance
    * steal horses from each other constantly
    * only two tribes had enough horses to reproduce the herd
    * young men won over old men and women because
        * the idea of the "Comanche Warrior" became big
        * favored certain activities of young men over others
        * the most aggressive, hard-ass males were the ones that succeeded
        * changed from egalitarian society to a patriarchal society
* **Counting Coups** - the most important war honor
    * If there are two enemies in front of you, let them take a shot at you and then hit them without killing them
    * So macho that you don't need to kill them first
    * Touching of the enemy = Coup
    * Feathers on headdress represented coups
    * story about two plains indians in a macho battle
        * one went undercover as the enemy and instead of stealing the most valuable horses, he went and said hi to everyone and touch their shoulder so he collected like 15 coups
        * other snuck into a white rancher's house and killed the husband and stole the wife
* status of women plummeted

## Status of women

* Pre-horse days, status of women roughly equal to the women of Ju'hoansi
    * i.e., equal to men
* After buffalo hunting begins, men control of wealth
* if a women didn't want to get married, would she be able to express her dissatisfaction?
    * Elope
        * couple elopes and lives in another band
        * once gives birth, come back to original tribe
        * husband that eloped with brings a bunch of horses to the woman's father to smooth things over
            * combined with the baby, it's usually enough to make things better
        * BUT the father could reject the horses and could even kill his daughter in a gruesome way (draw and quarter)
            * rare, but still could happen
            * daughter's calculated gamble
    * Philander (cheating)
        * cheating can go on for decades and everyone knows and it's fine
        * it's only a problem after it's been publicly announced
        * now that it's public, I must kill the wife
            * can't kill the lover because men rely on each other in war
        * "Cut nose woman" - cut off her nose
            * you are allowed to kill your wife, but maim her instead so she is no longer appealing to other men and can stay in your house to do your work
            * replacing her is too expensive (give a bunch of horses to her father)
    * committing suicide
        * hang yourself and kill their baby daughters to make a statement
        * according to "gods", hanging yourself = purgatory, but if you hang yourself and your baby daughter you will never enter heaven and you will be dragging the tree you hang yourself on forever
            * women who kill themselves try to find the smallest tree that they could find
        * ("heaven" refers to the place where you reconnect with your loved ones that died)
* Honor killings
* After moving on the reservations, position of men crumbled due to collapse of economic system

## Rituals

* Sweats
    * happens whenever people are together
* sundance
    * (not ghost dance)
        * harbinger of end of the culture
    * one time when large groups of lakota get together
        * celebrate being lakota
    * when people are in crisis, they make vows to higher power
        * if I get through this, I will do the sundance
        * pierce though skin using skewers, making a sacrifice
    * in 20th centuries, missionaries made sundance illegal
        * ensured the survival of the sundance because of the lengths they had to go to do it
        * now also protest in addition celebrating being lakota
        * tribal identity - whole tribe gathers
* smudging
    * burn braided grass, let smoke wash over you
    * not necessarily organized, it happens all the time
* Powwows, giveaways
* Less of religion and more of spiritual existence
* birds, trees, plants are other versions of themselves
    * two-wing nation = birds
* connection to the land/attachment to nature to give children the earth
