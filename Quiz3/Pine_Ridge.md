# Pine Ridge

* Most populated Lakota reservation.
* Crazy horse - most well known resistance leaders - comes from pine ridge

## Dissatisfied with existing homes

1. poorly built - doesn't last very long
2. cluster housing
    * looks like cul de sacs, popular in white society, so was built to emulate that
    * disrupted **Tiyospaye** (kinship group) - sense of family
        * they used to do hunting, warring, etc. with their tiyospaye
        * moved from familial land
        * once moved to cluster housing, living with unrelated people
        * Pine Ridge is large (size of Connecticut and Delaware), can not reach out to family for help because they most likely are vey far away
    * often had a lot of space that went unused, built for the lifestyle that whites thought they wanted rather than the lifestyle that they had
        * e.g., family room -> dining room

Thurman - Head of households are typically female. And not usually artist.

Doris - Grandma head of household raise grandchildren because her children were alcoholics

Little boy - new house is like a mansion

Whitemud - want to move house on to family land, but no money to buy materials to build house

Fema - Oglawa tribe at Pine Ridge got FEMA to build 214 homes

* poor build quality, last 4 years at best
* in reality, much less than that

## Poverty porn

* donate to our nonprofit beacause we're so sad and impoverished :(
* poverty may look a lot like poverty porn, but may not always look like that
    * e.g., kids in whitemud family were still happy and playful because they're still kids
* if it was always as one-dimensionally bad as poverty porn shows it to be, why would anyone want to go back to the reservation?
* we're poor, but we're not poor in culture
* it means people have hope
* 60+ NGOs on Pine Ridge, but they're mostly helping to tread water
    * only a few are actually helping, and they're all local
    * everyone else just has a job to do
