# Pine Ridge

* Most populated Lakota reservation.
* Crazy horse - most well known resistance leaders - comes from pine ridge
* Indian pricing - price lowered for indians because they can't afford

## Dissatisfied with existing homes

1. poorly built - doesn't last very long
2. cluster housing
    * looks like cul de sacs, popular in white society, so was built to emulate that
    * disrupted **Tiyospaye** (kinship group) - sense of family
        * they used to do hunting, warring, etc. with their tiyospaye
        * moved from familial land
        * once moved to cluster housing, living with unrelated people
        * Pine Ridge is large (size of Connecticut and Delaware), can not reach out to family for help because they most likely are vey far away
    * often had a lot of space that went unused, built for the lifestyle that whites thought they wanted rather than the lifestyle that they had
        * e.g., family room -> dining room

* Thurman - Head of households are typically female. And not usually artist.
* Doris - Grandma head of household raise grandchildren because her children were alcoholics
* Little boy - new house is like a mansion
* Whitemud - want to move house on to family land, but no money to buy materials to build house
* FEMA - Oglawa tribe at Pine Ridge got FEMA to build 214 homes
    * poor build quality, last 4 years at best
    * in reality, much less than that

## Poverty porn

* Diane Sawyer - documentary about child poverty on the rez
    * so unrelentingly sad
    * but what about when thee cameras were off? they're still kids being kids
* Fossilizes poverty as the entire representation of the culture
* donate to our nonprofit because we're so sad and impoverished :(
* poverty may look a lot like poverty porn, but may not always look like that
    * e.g., kids in whitemud family were still happy and playful because they're still kids
* if it was always as one-dimensional-ly bad as poverty porn shows it to be, why would anyone want to go back to the reservation?
* we're poor, but we're not poor in culture
* it means people have hope
* 60+ NGOs on Pine Ridge, but they're mostly helping to tread water
    * only a few are actually helping, and they're all local
    * everyone else just has a job to do
* "why are they there? there must be something wrong with them"
    * victim blaming

## Factonalism

* Two kinds of people in the reservations:
    * friendlies
    * hostiles: agents were scared of how to handle hostiles
* Any who left the reservation was a hostile and would be subject to arrest
* ghost dance: no lakota originally, but it was an idea that spread through native north America
    * They sing and pray for the end of the world, but they also prepared to take on the united states
    * Ghost shirts - war shirts designated to be bullet proof
        * Because they were singing their shirts would be bullet proof
* **First wounded knee** - holocaust version for the lakota
    * Middle of winter
* **2nd wounded knee** - actual takeover of small community on pine ridge community of wounded knee
    * Lasted for two months
    * When it ended, pine ridge descended into a civil war
* Factionalism gave rise to divisions
    * The 2nd wounded knee were the same factions that caused the divisions in the first wounded knee
* You cant fix an isolated problem
    * Connected to alcoholism
    * Connected to the crappy food they eat
* Mixed blood vs full blood is not about blood
    * Anyone can become an Iroquois
        * Iroquois capture prisoner of war, horribly torture
        * But, one woman lost a son and now wanted to adopt him as new one
        * Suddenly, one of Iroquois
    * Lakota also accept people as easily regardless of blood
