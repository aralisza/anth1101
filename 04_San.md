## San

## Film: Nai story of Kung

* marriage universal concept
  * finding an orderly way for people to reproduce
  * union of two family (unrelated) groups looking for structural alliance to avoid conflict
    * building relationships
  * social, political, economic arrangement
  * NOT marriage as we know of it in US
  * San - arranged marriage, sometimes from birth

* Egalitarian?
  * arranged marriage - no decision making ability
    * how equal are you?
  * how do you define gender equality?
  * Nai expressed her dislike of arrange marriage by refusing her husband and cheating on him
    * she is able to do it with impunity
  * Nisa - caused such a stink over family arranged marriage that the family let it go
  * Eventually the marriage works after the initial barrier because it is about:
    * providing for children
    * alliance between family is strong
    * access to land
    * etc.
  * In Ju'hoansi society, if arranged marriages fail, they can divorce and then the women get to choose
    * not viewed as a divorcee
    * 2nd and 3rd marriages are not arranged
    * anything goes, if it works, it works

* HIV rates very low
  * very far apart from others
  * women's status - if they want a condom they get it

* Why are women viewed as equal?
  * Economics is a subsistence system, so women's contributions are seen as equally important
  * Specifically, when men were unable to successfully hunt game (which is often, 2/3 of the time), women were able to gather enough to subsist society.
    * hunting-men/gathering-women is a tendency, but it's not strictly divided along gender lines
    * Not intrinsic to the activity, but it works well
    * Women could easily gather enough protein to subsist society vs hunting is a failed enterprise - Women provide majority of caloric intake for the group

* Sharing keeps a lid on jealousy
  * When Nai's daughter gets picked on for allegedly cheating, it's because Nai's "not sharing"
    * Erosion of their cultural system
  * Changing of cultural system has historically been devastating for indigenous communities
  * The first people to embrace new culture that is brought in are usually the ones that are on the fringes of the existing culture

## Political economy of egalitarian/bands

* Communal property relations
  * access to key resources for all
    * no one person or group has exclusive access key resources
  * no full-time division of labor
    * no specialists
    * everyone does everything
  * no wealth distinctions
  * windfalls and shortages are distributed evenly
    * never saying please or thank you
      * "it's your right to have a share of meat"
      * "with thanks, you make slaves"

* Avoiding envy
  * Hxaro: "gift giving"/sharing promote a widespread goodwill
    * creates a social bond
    * reciprocity - I give you something, you give me back something at some other point in time
      * lifetime arrangement, doesn't have to be soon
      * doesn't have to be same value
    * different from collective ownership because it relies on individuals seeking ways to give and receive gifts
  * envy/jealousy promote discord
    * want to *level* the differences to avoid friction
    * critical to egalitarian relations
    * Nai: can't take her money, but can make her feel unwanted
      * social capital: you're desireable because you share things
  * You know when someone's in need, you don't have to ask
