# Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Border

* More than 47% of US international trade headed for Mexico and more than 36% of Mexico international trade crosses through Laredo-Nuevo Laredo ports of entries
* Rio Grande has gone from a waterway between neighborhoods to an international boundary
    * People see each other as relatives of sorts but at other times as alien others
    * "The river divides and the river joins"
    * "We're at each others' throats on Monday and at each others' weddings on Sunday"
* In Texas, Mexican identity was slowly stripped away and whitewashed
    * Martha and George Washington (kind of like prom king and queen) ceremony
    * But in Lareto, Martha and George Washington was not white
    * Become **Abrazos ceremony** where mayor of Lareto and Nuevo Lareto come together as celebration
* The Tecos (of Laredo)
    * The only binational sports franchise in the world
* Border is permeable, influences and goods and people move across
    * Some can't be regulated
    * Some people don't care about being regulated
* More than one notion of nation going on

## Three nationalisms

* Tecos is all three

### Autonational

* Traditional notion of nationalsim
* Art, symbols, music, etc can engender national pride

### Binational

* The first person that died due to pollution in Rio Grande made news on both sides
* Both cities got together to solve problem
* Differs from transnationalism because you would not confuse yourself as American or Mexican, but you work together

### Transnationalism

* Breakdown of borders
* Laredo and Nuevo Laredo together become a single, different entity
* Operate seamlessly between nations
* Created Republic of Rio Grande because the cities dealt with each other so often with common problems
    * Was crushed brutally by both US and Mexico
* **Anthropological fluidity**
    * seamless movement of people, goods, capital between donor nation and host nation
    * Oaxacan Mexicans in California
    * Dominican Yorks
