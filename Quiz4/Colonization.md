# Colonialism

* When globalization first started happening, people thought it was a new thing
    * But, mercantilism was also a form of globalization

## Dependency Theory

* Thought of the word as haves and have-nots
    * Developed and developing nations
* Why can't the have-nots feed themselves?
    * Are they in the worst part of the world (something wrong with their land)? Is there something wrong with them?
        * The land is fine, they were subsistence farming just fine
        * Victim blaming
* Haves and have-nots exist because of each other
    * You are poor because of the rich and you are rich because of the poor
    * E.g., your clothes are the result of labor exploitation
        * You wouldn't be able to buy as many clothes if the labor was paid fairly
* Core = Developed nations, Periphery = Developing nations
* Moral component, not only economic
* The colonized people are seen as backwards, colonizers still think they have moral high ground
    * "The West Indies is the place where England finds it convenient for the production of goods"
        * The "place" that is "convenient", not seen as sovereign

### Force

* Convert subsistence land into cash crop farming, now how do we feed people?
    * Import food, plugging people into a world economy
    * Promotes total dependency and disrupts the system that was traditionally working
* By physical force
* By a burdensome tax
    * More efficient
    * If people don't comply with converting to cash crop, tax the subsistence farming heavily in coin
        * The people typically don't have a lot of cash

### Direct takeover of land

* In Feudalism, there was an agreement between serfs and lords. Serfs still had connection to the land
* Final process of colonization - removing them from the land (shift to capitalism)
* Once they have been removed from the land, how do they earn a living?
    * Now, you are a laborer
    * Sell labor on the plantation

### Hegemony
* Governing with the (manufactured) consent of the governed
* This is where the "mixed bloods" come in
    * No longer need to use force, the "mixed bloods" will rule for you
    * Mulattos in Caribbean - actual mixed blood
        * The darker you are, the closer you are to laborer
        * The lighter you are, the closer you are to the overlords
    * They believe in their superiority
    * Social self loathing - inferiority of the colonized
        * The creation of the arrogant colonizer is simultaneous as the creation of the self-loathing colonized
        * The most powerful weapon is to control the minds of the colonized
        * Good hair, bad hair
* Third world nationalism is the cure
