# Parts of Globalization

* Homogenization
* Social flows
* Flexible Accumulation
  * Flexibility that comes with globalization/time-space compression
  * Ability of companies to split up the process of production to different countries all across the world  this is done to make production cheaper
  * Spreading out various tasks and material needs of producing an item all across the world
  * Causes race to the bottom

## Lexus & Olive Tree

* One of the first books on globalization
* Lexus = globalization
* Olive tree = the traditional notion of nation (nationalism)
* Contested relationship between the nation and global processes
    * Traditional nation state does not go away
    * It’s important to look at the relationship of the nation with other countries
* Nation states vs. global markets
* Nation states vs. individuals
    * Ex: Osama Bin Laden (powerful person, treated as a nation state)
* Arbitrage
    * Buying or selling something knowing the price in advance
    * You can take advantage of the market
* Arbitrage (Nations)
    * We now know more about other nations, affects how we think about/interact with them
    * Nations are no longer isolated
* Benedict Anderson - imagined community

## Time-Space Compression

* Technologies allow us to be in two places at once
* Technologies shorten the gap between places
* Ex: Jew praying at Wailing wall, calling cousin (phone) who couldn’t make it
* Ex: ability to move massive amounts of capital around the world in seconds

## Distanciation

* Frequencies of relationships between distant parties increases
* But quality of relationships decreases
* This and time-space compression come in pairs
* e.g., is skype conversation the same as a real conversation?

## A Race To The Bottom

* Technological advances allow companies to move around the world to search for cheap labor, materials, and compliant laws in order to maximize profits
* Take advantage of cheap labor, cheap supplies, disposable
* Cheap, unskilled, infinite
* Ex: Nike in Vietnam/Indonesia
* **Offshoring**: moving facilities to "friendly" locals
* **Outsourcing**: moving part of the work process externally

## Increased migration

* Accelerated movement of people within and between countries
    * 232 million internally and 700 million internally (typically rural to urban)
* E.g., having to look for jobs all over the world to find one, CS people change jobs every 2 years
* Your job determines your location, not the other way around anymore
* Causes shifting pattern of work forces people to relocate for subsistence
    * Migrants send back **remittances** to family at home
        * Economic lifeline, subsidize life back home
    * Creates **transnational** communities
* Economic migrants that end up staying permanently identifies both with their home country and new country
    * Don't come to the country with the decision to become American
    * Think they're going to retire back to home country, then realize they won't be when the time comes (like my parents lol)
    * **Liminal** people
* **Refugees**: category of migration based on political factors rather than economic

## Uneven development

* Globalization is experienced unevenly
* There are winners and losers
    * e.g., horses in plains indians
* Roughly half the world has no internet access
* Global poverty has increased over the past 20 years
    * 40% of the world's population lives in poverty, defined as income of less than $2/day

## Consequences of Globalization

* Living conditions
